 <span style= "font-family: 'Georgia', serif"> <span style= "color:red"> Hi! My name is Samhita, and this is my blog for AP CSP! I am a sophomore excited to be in this class. I took this class because I love technology and problem-solving, and I aspire to have a future relating to Computer Science. My parents grew up in India, but I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, then I moved to the Bay Area seven years later, and just two years ago, I moved to San Diego. I am a dancer and do Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance style. I also love nature and try to soak in as much sunshine as I can, often reading on grassy hills and hiking. My love for the outdoors goes hand in hand with being a varsity cross country and long-distance track runner for Del Norte. Through creating my freeform image, I learned how to put my thoughts into drawings and symbols, so other people can understand them. This is similar to writing code in order for a computer to process the statements.

### <span style= "font-family: 'Georgia', serif"> <span style="color: purple;"> To add this image, I downloaded it onto my computer, and added it to github, which gave me a link that I could enter on vscode. Then, I noticed that it was compressed, so I added parameters to make it the size I wanted.

### <span style= "font-family: 'Georgia', serif"> <span style="color: green;"> One problem I faced was opening my server on my chromebook. Originally, I got the server address and I opened it directly on another window on Google Chrome. After replacing 0.0.0.0 with localhost, and it still not responding, I realized that I was supposed to open it on my cloud workspace. With hindsight, it doesn't seem like a major issue, however, it set me back a day because I wasn't able to open my webpage.
